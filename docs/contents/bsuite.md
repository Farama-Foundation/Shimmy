## Behavior Suite

### [DeepMind Behavior Suite](https://github.com/deepmind/bsuite)

[Behavior Suite](https://github.com/deepmind/bsuite) is a collection of carefully-designed experiments that investigate various aspects of agent behavior through shared benchmarks. 

Shimmy provides compatibility wrappers to convert [Behavior Suite](https://github.com/deepmind/bsuite) environments to [Gymnasium](https://gymnasium.farama.org/).
