## Atari Environments

### [Arcade Learning Environment (ALE)](https://github.com/mgbellemare/Arcade-Learning-Environment)
[ALE](https://github.com/mgbellemare/Arcade-Learning-Environment) is a collection of 50+ Atari 2600 games powered by the [Stella](https://stella-emu.github.io/) emulator.

Shimmy provides compatibility wrappers to convert all [ALE](https://github.com/mgbellemare/Arcade-Learning-Environment) environments to [Gymnasium](https://gymnasium.farama.org/).
